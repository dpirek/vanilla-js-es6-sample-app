# Sample App in ES6 Only

I wanted to prove that you can write a single page app in only ES6 without any build or framework.

The future is NOW.

### TODO: ###
* Figure out a state manager.
* Maybe move to "component only mode" (now it's kind of MVCish).
* Maybe introduce some type of build if ES6 loading becomes slow.
* Update component creation from document.registerElement to createElement
